# Blockchain Based Smart Contracts: Comphrensive Study

I have written a research paper based upon Smart Contracts which are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss. This research paper got published in International Journal - IRJMETS (INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL OF MODERNIZATION IN ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE)
